# **App Name**: KineticsLab

## Core Features:

- Parameter Input: Configure parameters for the Arrhenius equation including pre-exponential factor, activation energy, temperature and initial concentration. Take user inputs.
- Reaction Rate Simulation: Simulate the reaction rate using the Arrhenius equation. Include rate of reaction as well
- Graphical Visualization: Visualize the change in reaction rate graphically, with options to overlay graphs for different parameter sets.
- Catalyst Influence: Include common catalyst options and allow users to adjust catalyst concentration to observe its effect on reaction rate.
- AI-Powered Terminology Assistance: A tool tip that intelligently provides explanations of chemical terms, using AI to determine if the user might not understand the term.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5) to convey intelligence and sophistication, inspired by scientific research.
- Background color: Light grey (#F0F2F5), creating a clean, distraction-free backdrop that promotes focus.
- Accent color: Vivid violet (#BA68C8) to highlight key interactive elements such as simulation buttons and adjustable parameters, clearly guiding the user.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern, readable interface suitable for displaying technical data.
- Use flat, minimalist icons to represent different parameters and controls.
- Divide the interface into clear sections for parameter input, graph display, and results.
- Use subtle animations on the graph to highlight changes in reaction rate.
