# ⚗️ Chemistry Kinetics Lab

**Chemistry Kinetics Lab** is an interactive web application designed to simulate and visualize chemical reaction kinetics. Built using **Next.js** and **React**, this tool allows users to explore how factors like temperature, concentration, and catalysts influence reaction rates using models such as the **Arrhenius equation** and simple kinetic laws.
